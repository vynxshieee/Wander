# Wander
Wander is a simple entomology-inspired e-commerce website I created as a prerequisite to completing my Introduction to Computing class, 1st Year College. This is the first website/project I've coded.

Note:

-With zero experience, you can see that my files are quite messy.

-The CSS files are also not clean/simplified since I was only experimenting with how they all work lmao

-My Galleria page is inspired by a YT vid's code I just forked.

-Pardon me for my dumb beginner's project, I'll improve astronomically the next time I attempt to start a new web dev project.
